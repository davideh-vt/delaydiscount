\title{Estimate the hyperparameters for each group, as well as the variance
components of the model, using maximum likelihood estimation.}
\usage{
estimate_hyperbolic_model_params(dd_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{dd_data}{A specially formatted data frame as returned by the
prepare_data_frame function.}
}
\value{
A list of two objects
ln_k_mean is a data frame with estimates of the hyperparameters of each group
along with the standard error of the estimate. The hyperparameter for each
group can be interpreted as the mean ln(k) for a subject in that group.
var is a vector with entries sigma_sq and g
sigma_sq is the variance of the observed transformed indifference
conditioned on the true ln(k) for the subject
g is related to the variance of the subject random effect, which is equal to
g*sigma_sq/T, where T is the number of time points.
pairwise_f_tests is a data frame containing the results of all of the pairwise
f-tests for equality of hyperparameters. The columns col1 and col2 contain
the groups of the pairwise F-test. The F_stat column contains the F-statistic,
the p_value column contains the p-value, and the df1 and df2 columns contain
the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom, respectively.
model_test is a data frame containing the result of the F-test for equality
of all hyperparameters. It contains the columns F_stat, p_value, df1, and df2,
which have the same meaning as in the pairwise_f_tests data frame.
