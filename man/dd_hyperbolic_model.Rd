\title{This function gets model parameter estimates for each group, including hyperparameters
and estimates of the variance components (the observation error and subject random effect).
It also gets F-test results for pairwise equality for the hyperparameter for
each pair of groups, and overall equality of all hyperparameters.}
\usage{
dd_hyperbolic_model(dd_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{dd_data}{A specially formatted data frame as returned by the
prepare_data_frame function.}
}
\value{
A list with the objects
ln_k_mean is a data frame with estimates of the hyperparameters of each group
along with the standard error of the estimate. The hyperparameter for each
group can be interpreted as the mean ln(k) for a subject in that group.
var is a vector with entries sigma_sq and g
sigma_sq is the variance of the observed transformed indifference
conditioned on the true ln(k) for the subject
g is related to the variance of the subject random effect, which is equal to
g*sigma_sq/T, where T is the number of time points.
