\title{Estimate the hyperparameters for each group, as well as the variance
components of the model, using maximum likelihood estimation.}
\usage{
estimate.hyperbolic.model.params(dd_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{dd_data}{A specially formatted data frame as returned by the
prepare_data_frame function.}
}
\value{
A list of two objects
ln_k_mean is a data frame with estimates of the hyperparameters of each group
along with the standard error of the estimate. The hyperparameter for each
group can be interpreted as the mean ln(k) for a subject in that group.
vars is a vector with entries sigma_sq and g
sigma_sq is the variance of the observed transformed indifference
conditioned on the true ln(k) for the subject
g is related to the variance of the subject random effect, which is equal to
g*sigma_sq/T, where T is the number of time points.
