\title{Perform an F-test for equality of some combination(s) of hyperparameters.}
\usage{
hyperbolic_model_f_test(dd_data, hypothesis)
}
\arguments{
\item{dd_data}{A specially formatted data frame as returned by the
prepare_data_frame function.}

\item{hypothesis}{A list of string vectors. Each string is the name of a
group. No group appears in more than one vector. Each vector represents a set
of hyperparameters that are assumed to be equal under the null hypothesis.}
}
\value{
A list with the entries
F_stat, the test statistic of the F-test,
p_value, the p-value of the F-test
df1, the numerator degrees of freedom of the F-test (dimensionality of H0)
df2, the denominator degrees of freedom of the F-test
}
\description{
This function is a helper function for dd_hyperbolic_model.
We recommend not using this function on its own.
